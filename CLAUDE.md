# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**FF Slot Machine** — a Chrome extension that finds ESPN fantasy trades and waiver
adds which raise a team's projected *starting-lineup* points. It is the whole
project; there is no server, no build step, and no other entry point.

The name is literal rather than a joke about luck: the engine matches players to
lineup **slots** through ESPN's `eligibleSlots` and never models positions at all.

## Commands

```bash
node extension/test/parity.mjs     # the whole test suite, ~2s
```

Load the extension with `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked →
`extension/`. There is nothing to build; it is plain ES modules.

## Architecture

```
extension/
  manifest.json      MV3
  background.js      opens the page; nothing else lives here
  panel.html/.js     the UI
  panel.css          the analytics-terminal look
  engine/
    league.js        ESPN API -> normalized model; settings; volatility
    lineup.js        optimal lineup for any slot configuration
    swaps.js         precomputed (out, in) values
    search.js        shapes, N-sided trades, three-way, free agents
    season.js        Monte Carlo season projection
  test/parity.mjs    371 assertions against a frozen league
```

**Fetching happens in the page, not the service worker.** MV3 terminates idle
service workers after ~30s and a full season pull takes longer. Extension pages
carry the same host permissions — CORS-free, cookies attached — with no termination
risk. `background.js` only opens the page.

## Load-bearing decisions

**The engine models slots, not positions.** ESPN gives every player an
`eligibleSlots` array and every league a `lineupSlotCounts` map, so players are
matched to slots directly. That is what makes superflex, IDP, TQB, `RB/WR` and
`WR/TE` work with no special cases. Position strings are display-only — never key
logic on them.

**The lineup solver is a transversal-matroid greedy.** Players simultaneously
seatable in slots form a matroid, so greedy by descending value is optimal for
*any* slot structure. The older "fill dedicated slots then flex" shortcut is only
valid for nested eligibility and was measured wrong 8% of the time when `RB/WR` and
`WR/TE` coexist. Do not reintroduce it as a fast path; the matroid solver runs at
~1 µs per team-week.

**Nothing in the search is approximated.** Three-way is exhaustive via `swaps.js`.
A marginal-value pruning heuristic was measured at 57% recall and rejected.

**Time windows stay separate.** `gain` / `reg` / `playoff` / `bye` / `full` disagree
with each other, and that is the point: a trade can be positive on the season
average while hurting the record that decides seeding. Never collapse them.

**Read settings, never derive them.** `matchupPeriods` maps a matchup to the weeks
it spans (a two-week final is `{"16": [16,17]}`); `playoffMatchupPeriodLength` can
be 0 when lengths vary by round; `playoffReseed` can be false; a league with no
divisions still reports one named "League Standings".

**Filter ESPN stats on `seasonId`.** ESPN returns the prior season's projection for
the same scoring period alongside the current one. Matching on `statSourceId`,
`statSplitTypeId` and `scoringPeriodId` alone silently reads last season — measured
~15% low.

**Volatility is measured, not assumed.** `statSourceId: 0` gives the prior season's
actual weekly scores in the same payload as projections; the residual is real
league-scored volatility. Team sigma is the root of the summed variance of that
week's starters, so it follows roster composition.

## Testing

`extension/test/fixture.json` and `golden_1for1.json` are a frozen ten-team league
with names removed. They were produced by an independent Python implementation and
verified line for line before it was retired, so they are now the contract rather
than a convenience. A mismatch means the engine changed — regenerate them only on a
deliberate decision that the new behaviour is right.

## Privacy

Everything runs locally against ESPN's read API using the browser's own session. No
backend, no analytics, no league data leaves the machine. Keep it that way.
